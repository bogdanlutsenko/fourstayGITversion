Hello Bogdan!
How are you doing? 


Not bad! :)
How about you?


Me too, working on git, trying do repeat all this step!
I did request pull and merge in my code. It is easy! 
What did you do? I got email about changed in your code. 

I can not really see how the "request pull" working. I've requested new pool 
but I can not see what is the pourpose. Can you request pull and putt my name there so I can see?


You have to create new Branch, and clone you project in Eclipse, with all branches, after in Eclipse select second branche, 
change code and push as second branch. 
after you can do request pull!

When I clone you project i selected only master, didn't select devop branch (((
