Hello Bogdan!
How are you doing? 


Not bad! :)
How about you?


Me too, working on git, trying do repeat all this step!
I did request pull and merge in my code. It is easy! 
What did you do? I got email about changed in your code. 

I can not really see how the "request pull" working. I've requested new pool 
but I can not see what is the pourpose. Can you request pull and putt my name there so I can see?
